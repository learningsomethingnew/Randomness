## Randomness

Randomness is the first of two parts in exploring randomness. 

###Monty-Hall Dilemma

* Context: 
* A contestant goes on stage and is presented three doors. One of the doors has a valuable prize while the other two have 'Zonks', or something of little value. The goal is to come out with the winning prize.
* Gameplay:
  * There are 3 doors
    * 1 door has a prize
    * 2 doors have a zonk
  * Player selects 1 door
  * Monty reveals 1 door does not have what they need
  * Player chooses to do:
    * Swap Doors
    *     Stay
  * Player wins/loses on reveal
 
* The reason that this is a Dilemma is that it was widely believed that once when a door was revealed as a zonk that it was a 50/50 shot. In reality, it is more like a 2/3rds and that it is better to swap. The goal of this sim is to find out if it is better to stay, swap, or randomomly choose to stay or swap.
